# Job Market Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I examine job postings related to data. I evaluate jobs in various ways, with a focus on postings in the US due to their diversity. I assess job locations, whether they are remote or not, and salaries in different ways. Additionally, I analyze the top skills required for these jobs and the skills associated with high-paying positions. In summary, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of data-related jobs in the US.
